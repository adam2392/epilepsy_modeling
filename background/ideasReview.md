[1] Fragility in Dynamic Networks: Application to Neural Networks in the Epileptic Cortex. D. Sritharan, S. Sarma. Neural Computation 2014

1. Extend fragility model with biophysical models using HH model?
	- attempt to encompass the physiological situations of abnormal axonal sprouting (increased/decreased excitation/inhibition), Chandelier cell loss
	- build a procedure for fitting the average firing behavior of biophysical models into probabilistic framework on the population model level

2. Incorporating Synaptic Plasticity by time varying the structural connectivity on slow scale $\tau_s$ >> $\tau_n$, where $\tau_n$ is the time scale of the node dynamics.

3. Building closed loop feedback controller based on detecting fragility? Seems initial work was done by:
